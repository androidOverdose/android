    <p2> sorry that i did not post anything, i got grounded, and got my stuff taken away. but i'm back now!
      i decided to be stupid and call the cops on the kid who was saying stuff about me, i thought they would make where he could not speak to me, but no.
      they told the school, and the school gave me 2 days of oss. so my grandparents took my phone. but i hope to make today great,
      even know all that went down. </p2>
