    <p2>Many websites and apps use Google services to improve their content and keep it free.
      When they integrate our services, these sites and apps share information with Google.

For example, when you visit a website that uses advertising services like AdSense,
      including analytics tools like Google Analytics, or embeds video content from YouTube,
      your web browser automatically sends certain information to Google. This includes the URL of the page youâ€™re visiting and your IP address.
      We may also set cookies on your browser or read cookies that are already there. Apps that use Google advertising services also share information with Google,
      such as the name of the app and a unique identifier for advertising.</p2>
